1. What is a language ?
	It is a medium of communication between 2 entities or multiple entities

2. What is a program ?
	It is the set of instructions given to the computer.

3. What is programming language?
	It is a mode of communication between human and the computer where the
humans instruct the computer to perform some actions.

4. What is the most important aspect of a computer?
	Central Processing Unit (CPU) ~ Microprocessor
	Microprocessor is made up of semiconductor technology.
	( Made up of transistors (npn or pnp) )
	All semiconductor devices require constant power supply
	The microprocessor can under only voltages (0v or 5v) ~ H/w engineers
	The microprocessor can under only binary (0 or 1) ~ S/w engineers

5. What are the different categories of Programming language ?
	--> Machine Level Language	(MLL)
				It is a language in which the instruction are given in terms of 
binary 0 and biunary 1

	--> Assembly Level Language (ALL)
				It is a language in which the instruction are given in terms of 
neumonics which will be given to another software called as the Assemebler 
which will convert the ALL code to MLL because the processor can understand
only binary 0 and binary 1.

	--> High Level Language (HLL)
				It is a language in which the instruction are given in terms of 
human understandable manner and these instruction will be given to another 
software called as the Compiler which will convert the HLL code to MLL 
because the processor can understand only binary 0 and binary 1.

6. What are the famous HLL that were present before java ?
	--> Basic Combined Programming Language (BCPL)
			Disdvantages:	
				It occupied more memory
				It was unstructured

	--> B language
			Disdvantages:	
				It was unstructured
				It was non-portable
				It was non-object oriented

	--> C language
			Disdvantages:	
				It was non-portable
				It was non-object oriented

	--> C++ Language
			Disdvantages:	
				It was non-portable

	--> Java Language
			Advantage:
				It occupied less memory
				It is portable
				It is object oriented
				It supports internet
		
7. What is non-portability?
		It is a feature where a program written and complied in 1 platform 
cannot be executed in another platform
	--> We can send HLL through the network but we should not send because
of the presence of Hacker.
	
8. What is a platform?
		It is a combination of Hardware (mp) and Software (os)
		(Since we are software engineers we focus only on software)

9. What is portability?
		It is a feature where a program written and complied in 1 platform 
can be executed in any other platform.
	Other names for portability are:
		--> Platform Independency
		--> Arch Neutrality
		--> Write once run anywhere feature (WORA)
		--> Portability

10. Which are the 3 important memory devices of a computer ?
		--> Microprocessor
		--> Ramdom Access Memory	(Primary Memory)
		--> Hard Disk Drive				(Seondary Memory)

11. Why should the computer have the above 3 important memory devices ??
		There is a expectation from the programmer that his memory devices must be:
			--> Fast
			--> Compact
			--> Cheap
			--> Non-Volatile 
	But all these 4 expectations cannot be fulfilled by a single memory device. Hence we have 3
important memory devices.
			--> Fast				(RAM)
			--> Compact			(RAM)	
			--> Cheap				(HDD)
			--> Non-Volatile 	(HDD)

12. What is the meaning of the term orientation ??
		--> Rotation			X
		--> Direction			X
		--> Organization		X
		--> Aim				X
		--> State				X
		--> Way of looking  X
		--> Point of view 	X
		--> Perspective 		YES

13. What is an Object ??
		An object is defined as the real world entity which has an existence

14. What is obejct orientation ??
		Perspective towards a real world entity is called as object orientation

15. What are the principles of Object orientation ?
		We have 5 important principles of object orientation:
		--> The world is collection of objects
		--> No object is useless every object is useful
		--> Every object is under constant interaction and no object is isolated.
		--> Every object belongs to one type and that type in Object Orientation we call it as 
			 a class and the class doesnot exist in reality.
		--> Every object has something and does something
